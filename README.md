## Basic Details
### Team Name: [CodeVerse]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Neha M] - [Govt. Engineering College, Palakkad]

### Project Description
[This is a lighthearted ‚Äúuseless‚Äù web project that starts with a playful Challenge button leading to the main page. On the main page, the user enters a location, and the site pretends to fetch the weather‚Äîbut instead of real data, it generates a completely random temperature and gives an intentionally opposite, nonsensical piece of advice. It‚Äôs a fun twist on a weather app, built purely for humor and entertainment rather than accuracy.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Sometimes people want weather information‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs too boring when it‚Äôs correct.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[A web app that takes your location and gives you a completely random temperature along with a totally wrong piece of weather advice. Rain? We‚Äôll tell you to wear sunglasses. Sunny? Don‚Äôt forget your umbrella. Accuracy? Never heard of it.]
